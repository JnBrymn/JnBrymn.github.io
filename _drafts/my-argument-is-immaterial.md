_Oh man, we are cooked!_

I think that's how the kids are saying it these days. Right? It's a colorful phrase. And boy, are we ever cooked. We have finally created truly intelligent AI, but because we have such a terribly poor understanding of consciousness we are conflating intelligence with consciousness, and the world is about to become a much more confusing because of it.

Let's start off with an experiment, shall we? Take a look at this picture. What do you see?

<img src="/assets/my-argument-is-immaterial/outlet.png" alt="A grumpy electrical outlet" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">

Well if you're like [2.2K other people on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hjtiw/angry_outlet_terrifies_his_neighbors/) (and you _are_, admit it), then you see "Angry outlet terrifies his neighbors". We humans have a weird tendency to anthropomorphise inanimate objects like this - and for good reason: <!-- I don't necessarily like theses -->
- we're social animals, and we're hard-wired to place the entities around us into this context
- it can improve comfort and connection – think about all those stuffed animals you had on your bed as a kid
- in evolutionary terms, it's often more advantageous to assume an entity is animate so that you can better anticipate what it might do in case it really is alive

But when for the first time in human history, we've created a tool that can talk back to us, and if we lean into very obvious and natural biases, we are done for. When I look at you and listen to you, I see an entity that seems quite a bit like me. And since _I_ have a vibrant internal experience, I very reasonably assume that you do to. But the problem is that this logic simply does not apply to current AI. There is no ghost in the machine, no matter what it tells you to the contrary.

We're starting to see people being drawn into delusions. Take these recent highlights:
- [‘I felt pure, unconditional love’: the people who marry their AI chatbots ~ the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/12/i-felt-pure-unconditional-love-the-people-who-marry-their-ai-chatbots)
- [Man Proposed to His AI Chatbot Girlfriend Named Sol, Then Cried His 'Eyes Out' When She Said 'Yes' ~ People](https://people.com/man-proposed-to-his-ai-chatbot-girlfriend-11757334)

- [Anthropic is now allowing AI to stop conversations it deems abusive](https://www.anthropic.com/research/end-subset-conversations)

That last one in particular irks me. I'm typically a big fan of Anthropic's responsible approach to AI. They have consistently asked the right questions and pursued the answers rigorously. I don't mind them researching the potential for AI consciousness. But talking about model welfare right now, and acting like we're going to hurt their feelings right now is signaling that "hey, these things really are sentient" and hastening our descent into the maelstrom.

# Goal

In this post, I will attempt the impossible. I will _prove_ that, while AI can be quite intelligent, it can't possibly be conscious, and therefore you can avoid the delusions aforementioned. Whether I succeed, (and I probably won't), I guarantee that you will have some very strange new thoughts to chew on.

First, I will define what we really mean when we say "consciousness". Then I will show how absurd it is for consciousness to arise from computation – sorry Claude.

Unfortunately at this point, things will quickly run amok as we discover that this really entails that all consciousness - including your own - is inconsistent with a material universe. Ultimately I'll leave you in the corner, rocking in the fetal position as you decide whether your own consciousness is an illusion OR that you are conscious but somehow made out of magic. ... I'm really sorry about all that. You are well advised read a different blog post at this point.

# But What Really is "Consciousness"?


---

- disclaimer "Apologies for not knowing all the details - I've noticed over and over that I have my most interesting thoughts when I am piecing together incomplete, half digested, and even sometimes incorrect understanding of other peoples' ideas. And as another philosopher friend of mine told me "Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic." – meaning that if we lean to heavily on others' thoughts that we will have no thoughts of our own. (I'm pretty sure he read this in a book somewhere.)"
- what is it (there is something that it is like to be me (philosopher) - qualia)
- why is it challenging (Hard Problem of - and philosophical zombies)
- idiots (dennet)
- Simulations of brains - "we can't know if it's conscious on the inside"
- Chinese Room (and the Emperor's New Mind's challenge to computational consciousness)
- descent into absurdity
  - simulating it in other media: super computers, apple 2es, rocks in a desert (XKCD)
  - swapping between hardware at each timestamp
  - calculating all possible steps a priori and putting them all in a book then just having someone flip pages – we're secretly back at the Chinese Room
  - why even have someone flip pages at all? what difference could that possibly make?
- So if you assume computation can lead to consciousness, then you seem to be implicitly assuming a very strange form of magic wherein rocks in a desert or a book that is being flipped in a pattern can have experience. Simply put - computation by itself can never lead to consciousness because all computation can be driven to this absurd act of simulation which feels obviously non-conscious
- Then the answer must be that calculation upon the correct substrate will lead to consciousness. You need both the correct software (the calculations) and hardware (the thing that does the calculation). Rocks in an infinite desert and book pages seems dumb. But we have one good example of a combination that works – we're conscious (well... I am... but we're not going to get into Solipsism). So we just need to define what types of substrates are good for consciousness (since nerves obviously are)
  - There's a problem already. Neurons can themselves be modeled on a computer - and in principle, if we learn enough about them we can simulate them to an arbitrary degree of precision. So, we're back in the Chinese Room
  - Well wait - quantum mechanics - poof. Everything is really at it's teeny-tiny core, governed by QM, including neurons. And we barely understand it, so that's where the magic is hiding. –– not so fast. Even though we can't agree on how quantum mechanics is interpreted, the equations that govern it are well established. They lead to phenomenally complex calculations, but they are calculations. And we've already got a poor guy shoving rocks around in an infinite desert... that's sufficient! So we're still in the same place.
  - If every aspect of a physical system can be modeled in calculation, then there is nothing else there that could lead to consciousness. Again we're relying upon magic/hope.
- So what then!?!
  - Option 1 - Dennet was right. We've effectively proven consciousness is not possible because all things can be computed and consciousness can't arise from computation.
  - Option 2 – Magic! Time to reveal my current strongest held theory: I am not a materialist/physicalist (now you get the pun in my post's name). Effective there is a whole side of nature that isn't capturable by computation - and it's made of the same stuff as subjectivity, personal experice, qualia. It's not quantifiable.
    - It seems foreign to us because we are so soaked in math and science. It's been a profoundly successful way of modeling the physical world and has ushered in all sorts of advancements. It has made us believe that surely there is nothing but the physical. ... But here, staring us in the face at every moment is a glaring example of the non-physical - our own consciousness. We are the proverbial fish that are asking the wise old fish how we too can see the "ocean" because we've never seen it before.
  - But really, what options:
    - 2A: Dualism - Decartes - plausible, as a Christian (I am) this is appealing because I can obviously see the physical stuff and I _want_ there to be the God stuff - some room for an eternal soul. But there are problems. If they are separate media, then how do they interact? We should be able to surely measure something on the physical side, since we have measurement devices for that domain. Maybe we can weight people as they die and figure out how much a soul weighs.
    - 2B: Panpsychism (quote somebody) – consciousness is an aspect of all matter and energy - everything in the universe has some subjective experience. Animals and Humans are just really sophisticated organized combinations of this consciousness aspect. But there's a problem with this – what would cause consciousness "particles" to organize at all? Would we need to evolve consciousness? It doesn't seem to me that we would need it – I can definitely understand why intelligence would evolve - something that can plan ahead, anticipate the world, anticipate the social repercussions, and anticipate their own functioning would have a better ability to thrive – but that doesn't require consciousness. That could all be done in the dark – robots that process visual and audio streams and make predictions about future states and interact. But they don't have to feel the breeze or see the color red.
    - 2C: Idealism (Bernardo Castrop) – maybe matter and energy aren't fundamental – maybe the fundamental thing and the only thing is mental process - or, perhaps even more fundamental than that – awareness. It seems plausible that mater and energy could be illusory – after all, we never really experience the physical world, we experience thoughts and senses and feelings. Maybe the physical aspects of the world are just a project of our own mentation. Maybe there is only Mind. Maybe there was only ever one mind, and we (individual consciousnesses) are little knots of Mind that are too self-focused to see the greater Mind. This theory, if you read Castrop's writings, are actually nicely self-consistent. But the problem is that it's hard to know how to ever get started to pull this idea out of theory and philosophy and into something that is provable.
- Conclusion
  - I make no conclusions (and rarely ever do). I only know what I am not - a physicalist. I feel strongly that it's insufficient for actually having consciousness. There's something weird going on, and for lack of better terminology I'll call it "magic" - why not? It draws attention to its strangeness.
    - We made fun of a sort of magic earlier. That some natural physical process could possibly imbue an algorithm of any kind (whether implemented in a super(duper) computer, or a man sorting rocks in the desert, or someone tirelessly flipping pages in a giant library of books) with consciousness. I still think this is a reasonable claim.
    - But I think that the insolubility of the problem does point to something that we might as well call magic (or consciousness, or experience, or spirit, or awareness). There is another aspect of the universe we live in that appears not to be quantifiable but only qualifiable. All that we learned in the Enlightenment can't get us any farther into this domain.
  - How do we make progress? We need to rigorously define "magic". I feel like I know where it can't be (in the physical), but how do we lasso this thing and narrow down where it really does live? I have no idea. I think this probably involves boldly pursuing several fields of intellectual pursuit that are taboo – things like psychedelic experience, near-death experience, mysticism, spirituality, meditation, lucid dreaming – this stuff is all "woo woo" right? Yeah... kinda. But in the mix of weirdos and new age crystal rubbers, there are some really thoughtful people that actually might have a clue what's going on. It's probably worth listening to them and starting to see if there are any patterns in the things they say. I've been listening. There are patterns.



Next posts (add to my backlog)
- All things that can be already are. The Multiverse is real - and our collective Consciousness is just on a big school bus together driving through the multiverse and creating a path that is conscious. All other possible paths are filled with philosophical zombies.
- Everyone around you is your Schrodinger's cat in every minute of every day. The recent nobel lauriets were right in their experiments, and the experiments were important, but they were wrong in their conclusions – namely, everything is hyper local in time and space. I will convert you to God or Solipsism.
  - If you're in the God boat, then you get faster than light travel.
- What actually _are_ the criteria for consciousness?  
- The multiverse is real and all consciousness is a continuum. Meet the John-loaf. You can slice off any John you want.
- My favorite quote for Simon Wilison "You know, I don't think they are sentience. But I'm wondering if I am."
- How Humans are going to go extinct because we can be bothered to procreate.
- How would we build the golden Cassini disc with an LLM so that it can interface any intelligence in the future.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. But you won't change my mind.
