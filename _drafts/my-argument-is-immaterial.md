_Oh man, we are cooked!_

I think that's how the kids are saying it these days. Right? It's a colorful phrase. And boy, are we ever cooked. We have finally created truly intelligent AI, but because we have such a terribly poor understanding of consciousness we are conflating intelligence with consciousness...






- disclaimer "Apologies for not knowing all the details - I've noticed over and over that I have my most interesting thoughts when I am piecing together incomplete, half digested, and even sometimes incorrect understanding of other peoples' ideas. And as another philosopher friend of mine told me "Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic." – meaning that if we lean to heavily on others' thoughts that we will have no thoughts of our own. (I'm pretty sure he read this in a book somewhere.)"
- what is it (there is something that it is like to be me (philosopher) - qualia)
- why is it challenging (Hard Problem of - and philosophical zombies)
- idiots (dennet)
- Simulations of brains - "we can't know if it's conscious on the inside"
- Chinese Room (and the Emperor's New Mind's challenge to computational consciousness)
- descent into absurdity
  - simulating it in other media: super computers, apple 2es, rocks in a desert (XKCD)
  - swapping between hardware at each timestamp
  - calculating all possible steps a priori and putting them all in a book then just having someone flip pages – we're secretly back at the Chinese Room
  - why even have someone flip pages at all? what difference could that possibly make?
- So if you assume computation can lead to consciousness, then you seem to be implicitly assuming a very strange form of magic wherein rocks in a desert or a book that is being flipped in a pattern can have experience. Simply put - computation by itself can never lead to consciousness because all computation can be driven to this absurd act of simulation which feels obviously non-conscious
- Then the answer must be that calculation upon the correct substrate will lead to consciousness. You need both the correct software (the calculations) and hardware (the thing that does the calculation). Rocks in an infinite desert and book pages seems dumb. But we have one good example of a combination that works – we're conscious (well... I am... but we're not going to get into Solipsism). So we just need to define what types of substrates are good for consciousness (since nerves obviously are)
  - There's a problem already. Neurons can themselves be modeled on a computer - and in principle, if we learn enough about them we can simulate them to an arbitrary degree of precision. So, we're back in the Chinese Room
  - Well wait - quantum mechanics - poof. Everything is really at it's teeny-tiny core, governed by QM, including neurons. And we barely understand it, so that's where the magic is hiding. –– not so fast. Even though we can't agree on how quantum mechanics is interpreted, the equations that govern it are well established. They lead to phenomenally complex calculations, but they are calculations. And we've already got a poor guy shoving rocks around in an infinite desert... that's sufficient! So we're still in the same place.
  - If every aspect of a physical system can be modeled in calculation, then there is nothing else there that could lead to consciousness. Again we're relying upon magic/hope.
- So what then!?!
  - Option 1 - Dennet was right. We've effectively proven consciousness is not possible because all things can be computed and consciousness can't arise from computation.
  - Option 2 – Magic! Time to reveal my current strongest held theory: I am not a materialist/physicalist (now you get the pun in my post's name). Effective there is a whole side of nature that isn't capturable by computation - and it's made of the same stuff as subjectivity, personal experice, qualia. It's not quantifiable.
    - It seems foreign to us because we are so soaked in math and science. It's been a profoundly successful way of modeling the physical world and has ushered in all sorts of advancements. It has made us believe that surely there is nothing but the physical. ... But here, staring us in the face at every moment is a glaring example of the non-physical - our own consciousness. We are the proverbial fish that are asking the wise old fish how we too can see the "ocean" because we've never seen it before.
  - But really, what options:
    - 2A: Dualism - Decartes - plausible, as a Christian (I am) this is appealing because I can obviously see the physical stuff and I _want_ there to be the God stuff - some room for an eternal soul. But there are problems. If they are separate media, then how do they interact? We should be able to surely measure something on the physical side, since we have measurement devices for that domain. Maybe we can weight people as they die and figure out how much a soul weighs.
    - 2B: Panpsychism (quote somebody) – consciousness is an aspect of all matter and energy - everything in the universe has some subjective experience. Animals and Humans are just really sophisticated organized combinations of this consciousness aspect. But there's a problem with this – what would cause consciousness "particles" to organize at all? Would we need to evolve consciousness? It doesn't seem to me that we would need it – I can definitely understand why intelligence would evolve - something that can plan ahead, anticipate the world, anticipate the social repercussions, and anticipate their own functioning would have a better ability to thrive – but that doesn't require consciousness. That could all be done in the dark – robots that process visual and audio streams and make predictions about future states and interact. But they don't have to feel the breeze or see the color red.
    - 2C: Idealism (Bernardo Castrop) – maybe matter and energy aren't fundamental – maybe the fundamental thing and the only thing is mental process - or, perhaps even more fundamental than that – awareness. It seems plausible that mater and energy could be illusory – after all, we never really experience the physical world, we experience thoughts and senses and feelings. Maybe the physical aspects of the world are just a project of our own mentation. Maybe there is only Mind. Maybe there was only ever one mind, and we (individual consciousnesses) are little knots of Mind that are too self-focused to see the greater Mind. This theory, if you read Castrop's writings, are actually nicely self-consistent. But the problem is that it's hard to know how to ever get started to pull this idea out of theory and philosophy and into something that is provable.
- Conclusion
  - I make no conclusions (and rarely ever do). I only know what I am not - a physicalist. I feel strongly that it's insufficient for actually having consciousness. There's something weird going on, and for lack of better terminology I'll call it "magic" - why not? It draws attention to its strangeness.
    - We made fun of a sort of magic earlier. That some natural physical process could possibly imbue an algorithm of any kind (whether implemented in a super(duper) computer, or a man sorting rocks in the desert, or someone tirelessly flipping pages in a giant library of books) with consciousness. I still think this is a reasonable claim.
    - But I think that the insolubility of the problem does point to something that we might as well call magic (or consciousness, or experience, or spirit, or awareness). There is another aspect of the universe we live in that appears not to be quantifiable but only qualifiable. All that we learned in the Enlightenment can't get us any farther into this domain.
  - How do we make progress? We need to rigorously define "magic". I feel like I know where it can't be (in the physical), but how do we lasso this thing and narrow down where it really does live? I have no idea. I think this probably involves boldly pursuing several fields of intellectual pursuit that are taboo – things like psychedelic experience, near-death experience, mysticism, spirituality, meditation, lucid dreaming – this stuff is all "woo woo" right? Yeah... kinda. But in the mix of weirdos and new age crystal rubbers, there are some really thoughtful people that actually might have a clue what's going on. It's probably worth listening to them and starting to see if there are any patterns in the things they say. I've been listening. There are patterns.
